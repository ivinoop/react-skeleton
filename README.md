## Skeleton Loading aka Shimmer Effect

### The Project

This project is a demo to showcase Skeleton Loading / Shimmer effect for UI. This project is just one of the many ways to achieve this effect. While the core prinicple remains that a simple loader or a loading message is now outdated from a UX perspective, skeleton or shimmer effects tend to be relatively more interactive and easy going on the eyes.
